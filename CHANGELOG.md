# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

This file follows the Keep a Changelog section model: Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, and Security. The project package version is currently `0.0.5`; the visible Git history also contains a `v0.0.1` commit message without a tag in this checkout.

## [0.0.5] - 2026-08-26

### Added

- Same-origin Steam proxy route `/proxy/steam/*` in `ops/worker` (strict path allowlist, GET-only, server-side cache) with staging/prod Wrangler routes.
- Multi-proxy failover in the Steam Checker client: same-origin Worker proxy first, legacy third-party CORS proxy as bounded fallback (max four total attempts).
- Hand-rolled service worker (`public/sw.js`) with network-first HTML, cache-first hashed assets, stale-while-revalidate data/i18n JSON, and an unregister kill-switch; PROD-gated registration plus an offline banner.
- `docs/architecture.md` consolidating request/data-flow, deploy topology, pipeline contract, and key decisions.
- Optional Cloudflare Web Analytics beacon injected into every HTML entry when `CF_BEACON_TOKEN` is set at build time.
- Full publisher directory in the search sidebar: "Show all publishers" expands the top-20 list into a virtualized, filter-as-you-type directory of every publisher with counts.

### Changed

- Deploy topology resolved to artifact-only GitHub Pages: root-committed build outputs (`index.html`, `404.html`, `sitemap.xml`, `rss.xml`, `.nojekyll`, `CNAME`, synced asset trees) removed; custom domain marker moved to `public/CNAME`.
- Search filter checkboxes with zero dynamic counts render dimmed but stay clickable (`aria-disabled="true"` escape hatch).
- Print stylesheet extended: offline banner/dev toast/skip link hidden; rating badge colors preserved via `print-color-adjust`.
- Structure tests updated for artifact-only deploy topology and service worker presence.
- `npm run check` now runs a post-build `scripts/check-dist-structure.js` gate verifying serving-critical artifacts (`sw.js`, `CNAME`, `_headers`, HTML entries, data JSON) exist in `dist/`.

### Removed

- Dead re-export shim `src/shared/lib/search-constants.ts` and local backup file `config/vite.config.ts.backup`.
- Branch-root sync script `ops/scripts/sync-pages-root.js` and its `build:pages-root` npm script.
- Dead `nonce` parameter from the Worker's `htmlResponse`/`buildCspHeader` helpers (scripts were already blocked outright).

### Security

- Documented the dated accepted-risk rationale for `style-src 'unsafe-inline'` in SECURITY.md and `public/_headers`; documented the Cloudflare beacon CSP requirements.

### Fixed

- Duplicate `app.offlineBanner` key in both public i18n dictionaries (JSON.parse silently kept the last copy); a unit test now rejects duplicate keys in `public/assets/i18n/*.json`.
- Service worker no longer trims hashed immutable chunks: unhashed mutable assets moved to a dedicated cache, the offline SPA-shell fallback (`/404.html`) is precached on install, and FIFO caps are per-cache (data/i18n 8 entries, finite icon set 64) to stop image revalidation churn.
- Worker Steam proxy validates that upstream bodies parse as JSON before serving or caching, so an HTML interstitial can no longer be served/cached as `application/json` for the cache TTL.
- "No descriptors" search facet now uses dynamic counts like every other facet instead of a static total.
- ESLint config declares service-worker globals for `public/sw.js`.

## [0.0.3]

- `ChangelogLoadingFallback` component with `role="status"` and `aria-label` for accessible loading state.
- Property-based unit tests using `fast-check` for `normalizeSteamExtras` (type safety), `normalizeSearchText` (output invariants), `recordRecentlyViewed` (list invariants), and `parseIds` (safe parsing).
- Example-based unit tests for `steam-normalize.ts`, `text.ts`, and `use-recently-viewed.ts` covering edge cases (null, undefined, malformed data, boundary conditions).

### Changed

- README troubleshooting section converted to collapsible `<details>` blocks with bold summary text for improved readability.
- README architecture overview now links to `docs/architecture.md` for full details instead of duplicating information.
- `ChangelogModal` converted to default export (named export preserved for backward compatibility) to support `React.lazy`.
- `app-shell.tsx` uses `React.lazy` + `Suspense` + `ErrorBoundary` for the changelog modal instead of a static import.
- Rating and descriptor image components now use `<picture>` elements with WebP sources instead of plain `<img>` tags.
- `config/vite.config.ts` converted to async `defineConfig` to support conditional dynamic import of `rollup-plugin-visualizer`.
- Cloudflare Worker now redirects browsers to `/game/:id` instead of `/search/#id`.
- Worker preview page `og:url` and `shareUrl` now point to `/game/:id`.
- `SteamGameDetails` type extended with `header_image`, `short_description`, `type`, `is_free`, `genres`, `categories`, `platforms`, `price_overview`, `metacritic`, `required_age` fields.
- `steam-normalize.ts` uses properly typed field access instead of unsafe `as Record<string, unknown>` casts.
- `DataProvider` tracks pending request's `unlocked` state to prevent race conditions when `unlocked` changes mid-request.
- `useRequiredIgrsData` effect depends only on `ensureData` (stable ref) instead of the full context object.
- `DataProvider` uses `dataRef` to stabilize `ensureData` callback reference.
- `filterIndexedGames` uses `fuzzyScorePreNormalized` in the hot loop, skipping redundant normalization.
- `sortFilterResults` sorts in-place instead of copying the array (input is always fresh from `filterIndexedGames`).
- `platformIdFromName` uses a cached `Map<string, number>` reverse lookup instead of O(n) iteration.
- `SearchIndexItem` now includes pre-built `ratingIdSet`, `descriptorIdSet`, `platformIdSet` for O(1) filter checks.
- `findGameByName` accepts optional `nameIndex` parameter for O(1) exact matches before fuzzy fallback.
- Steam Checker sidebar always attempts local game match (not just when `rating_generated` is true).
- `search-page.tsx` reduced from ~350 lines to ~200 lines by using shared `GameDetailView`.
- `steam-checker-page.tsx` reduced from ~450 lines to ~210 lines by extracting sidebar.
- `domain.ts` converted to a 7-line barrel re-export (logic split into 4 focused modules).
- `highlight()` function returns plain text nodes for non-matching segments instead of wrapping in `<span>`.
- Descriptor icon sizing uses `object-fit: contain` with fixed 52×52px dimensions for consistency.
- Dark mode CSS converted from `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` to `[data-theme="dark"]` selectors for manual toggle support.
- Home page uses pre-computed `data.stats` instead of computing publisher/platform counts on every render.
- Recently viewed items show release year for disambiguation.
- Game page back button falls back to `/search/` when `history.length <= 2` (prevents exiting the app on direct navigation).

### Fixed

- Race condition in `DataProvider` where changing `unlocked` mid-request could return stale data from the wrong state.
- `useRequiredIgrsData` over-triggering effects on every state change (now depends only on stable `ensureData` ref).
- `use-recently-viewed.ts` infinite render loop caused by `getSnapshot` returning new array references (fixed with cached snapshot and `undefined` sentinel for invalidation).
- Memory leak in Steam Checker — abort controller now cleaned up on component unmount.
- Descriptor icon "character appearance" appearing larger than others (fixed with `object-fit: contain`).
- Tooltip not styled in dark mode (added `[data-theme="dark"] .descriptor-icon .tooltip` rule).

### Security

- Steam header image URLs validated through `safeHttpUrl()` before rendering in `<img>` tags.
- `parseSteamAppId` now validates hostnames — only extracts app IDs from `steampowered.com` and `steamcommunity.com` domains.
- `fetchJsonResource` validates `Content-Type` header before parsing response as JSON.
- Cloudflare Worker `gamesById` Map bounded to 50,000 entries to prevent unbounded memory growth.
